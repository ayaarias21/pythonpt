st.write("In an interview with Richard A. Clarke, a former senior White House advisor, the discussion revolves around "
         "the risks of cyber war and cyber terrorism and ways to address them. Clarke emphasizes that while "
         "cyber-attacks with limited objectives have occurred, a full-scale cyber war is yet to happen. He believes "
         "that U.S. leaders understand the threat but haven't taken sufficient action, suggesting that a large-scale "
         "cyber-attack may be necessary to alert the government causing legislative action. ")
st.write('According to Koehler, D, “Understanding Deradicalization” book, in the introduction in chapter 1, '
         'deradicalization is defined as a process of individual or collective cognitive change from criminal, '
         'radical, or extremist identities to a non-criminal or moderate psychological state. It involves turning '
         'away from a position of endorsing and using violence towards abstinence from violent means and/or '
         'attitudes. The process of deradicalization is differentiated from "disengagement," which only denotes a '
         'behavioral role change from offending to non-offending, The text also acknowledges the lack of conceptual '
         'clarity in the emerging topic on deradicalization and the variety of terms used globally to describe a '
         'similar process of moving away from violent ideologies or actions.  Additionally, in the text “The Cyber '
         'Defense Review – Countering the Cyber Threat”, it calls for the development of consensus, involving the '
         'unified effort to address the cybersecurity challenge by building consensus amongst public and private '
         'sectors. The development of public-private, cross-firm, and cross-industry liaison networks.  would be used '
         'to minimize localized thinking in threat response and enhance cooperation among firms and governments to '
         'address challenges that span different sectors. As well as this the addition of a tightly monitored '
         'information and communications network would provide rapidly declassified and anonymized threat indicators, '
         'facilitating the quick detection of emerging attacks, and enabling attribution. With these measures this '
         'will create a more team-based approach to this threat. ')
st.write('Moving away from the call to state effort counter of terrorism as countries are starting to recognize the '
         'need for specialized units to counter cyber threats, in the text “Countering Violent Extremism: A '
         'Peacebuilding Perspective”, by Goergia Holmer, the author understands the evolving nature of violent '
         'extremism, and aims for intersection between the counter violent extremism field and peacebuilding of '
         'people. While CVE primarily operates within the international and national security policymaking community '
         'for rules and regulations. peacebuilders also address the issue of violent extremism through conflict '
         'prevention efforts. The two fields increasingly intersect, although their approaches and practices may '
         'differ. With the idea of Peacebuilding contributions such as "do-no-harm" methodology, ensuring that '
         'programs do not have unintended negative consequences, building local capacity and engaging existing '
         'mechanisms, networks, and practices to contribute to Counter Violent Extremist efforts. An advocation for a '
         'more coordinated and inclusive approach that leverages the strengths of both to address the complex and '
         'evolving challenges of violent extremism. The article concludes with recommendations for holistic '
         'de-radicalization, emphasizing re-education, vocational training, financial support, and the creation of a '
         'conducive environment for reintegration. ')
