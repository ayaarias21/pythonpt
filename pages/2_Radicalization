article_intro = """
The article entitled ‚ÄúRethinking Online Radicalization‚Äù by Joe Whittaker does an excellent job at challenging 
the understanding of online radicalization by arguing against the separation between the ‚Äúonline‚Äù and ‚Äúoffline‚Äù realms. 
The article suggests both domains are inseparable, and we should understand the ontological nature of it and by doing 
this adopting a broader range of factors beyond online communication technologies when studying radicalization.
"""

article_main = """
The article refers to various models and theories proposed by scholars to explain the dynamics of online radicalization, 
emphasizing the potential for individuals to be exposed to extremist propaganda, engage in deviant behaviors, and form 
online communities that facilitate radicalization. When trying to theorize the process of online and offline dynamics, 
the article acknowledges the ambiguity of the term online radicalization and suggests that scholars should move beyond 
the narrow focus on online radicalization. It recommends considering the wider information environment while avoiding 
theories that exclusively explain how online radicalization works and advocates for holistic theories that consider 
individuals' predispositions, stressors, engagement with their environment, and systemic factors.

police_text = """
In correlation to this, the text by the International Association of Chiefs Police, entitled 
‚ÄúOnline Radicalization to Violent Extremism,‚Äù briefly touches on the topic highlighting the process by which individuals 
are exposed to extremist ideologies and gradually move from mainstream beliefs toward more extreme views. Online media, 
particularly social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, play a significant role in this process. The text 
emphasizes that the factors influencing radicalization vary from person to person, and the process itself can be dynamic, 
with individuals moving back and forth between stages. This also leads into different perspectives.
