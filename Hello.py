        "and governments.' ")

        'According to Brian Michael Jenkins, in his work "The Study of Terrorism: Definitional Problems," the term '
        '"terrorism" is described as "a fad word used promiscuously and often applied to a variety of acts of '
        'violence which are not strictly limited.... terrorism is what the bad guys do" (Jenkins), does an excellent '
        'job of highlighting the issue of definitional challenges and the varying definitions that can come with an '
        'unspecified and non-meticulous reality of the term.')

        'An example of the failure of getting the definition ‚Äúright‚Äù would be the US State Department characterizes '
        'it as "politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or '
        'clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience." While this definition serves as an attempt '
        'to capture what they believe to be terrorism, it is full of contradictions and complexities.')
    st.write(
        'One inherent challenge lies in the subjectivity of the term "politically motivated violence." What '
        'constitutes political motivation can vary widely, subject to individual or group perspectives. Additionally, '
        'the specification of "noncombatant targets" adds another layer of complexity. The distinction between '
        'combatants and noncombatants is not always clear, particularly in modern conflicts where the lines between '
        'these categories can blur. This ambiguity may lead to contradictions in the application of the definition. ')

        'While this describes terrorism on a broader range, like these many different definitions, cyber-terrorism '
        'too has not universally accepted definition. According to the text entitled ‚ÄúUnderstanding Cyber Terrorism '
        'from Motivational Perspectives‚Äù, by Yunos, Z, and S Sulaman, for an attack to be labeled as cyber terrorism, '
        'it must have a motivational component, result in death and/or large-scale destruction, and be politically '
        'motivated. The aim is to cause grave harm, severe economic damage, or extreme financial harm. Including this '
        'it is stated that there are three key elements must be satisfied to constitute cyber terrorism, '
        'including politically motivated cyber-attacks leading to death or bodily injury, cyber attacks causing fear '
        'and physical harm, and serious attacks targeting critical information infrastructures such as financial, '
        'energy, transportation, and government operations. ')
